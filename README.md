# üõ°Ô∏è Vigilance: A Privacy-Preserving Security Framework for Smart Cities

Vigilance is a sophisticated cybersecurity framework designed to act as a proactive "immune system" for smart cities. [cite\_start]It leverages **Federated Learning (FL)** to detect and neutralize cyber threats against critical IoT infrastructure‚Äîsuch as traffic signals, power grids, and surveillance cameras‚Äîwithout ever centralizing sensitive user data. [cite: 348, 360]

[cite\_start]This project was developed for the **Digitopia 2025** competition under the "Integrated Security Frameworks for Smart Cities" sub-challenge. [cite: 350]

## ‚ú® Key Innovations & Features

  * **Privacy-by-Design Architecture**: At its core, Vigilance uses Federated Learning to train models directly on edge devices. [cite\_start]Raw operational and personal data **never leaves the device**, ensuring compliance with modern privacy regulations by design. [cite: 360, 518]
  * **Advanced Weight-Centric Defense**: Instead of relying on potentially misleading accuracy metrics, the system's server analyzes the mathematical "behavior" of incoming model weights. [cite\_start]It uses advanced metrics like **Model Divergence** to detect coordinated attacks and statistical **Norms** to pinpoint individual bad actors. [cite: 556]
  * **Intelligent & Resilient Server**: The server features an advanced defense system with:
      * A **Grace Period** to prevent false alarms during initial system startup.
      * A **Quarantine & Parole System** that isolates identified malicious devices and treats them with suspicion even after they are released, preventing repeat offenses.
  * **Client-Side Self-Detection**: IoT device clients are smart enough to detect when their own data has been poisoned. If a device receives a high percentage of attack data, it will automatically report a catastrophic failure (`0.0%` accuracy) to the server, ensuring its immediate isolation.
  * [cite\_start]**Real-time Operator Dashboard**: A professional web dashboard, built with Streamlit, provides a live, at-a-glance overview of the system's security posture, including the current defense mode, global model accuracy, and the status of all connected devices. [cite: 348, 885]

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Vigilance simulation environment on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.10+
  * An MQTT Broker (like Mosquitto) installed and running.
  * The required Python libraries.

### 1\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohamed8221/Vigilance.git
cd Vigilance
```

### 2\. Install Dependencies

[cite\_start]Install all necessary Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file. [cite: 372]

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3\. Prepare the Dataset

[cite\_start]Before running the system for the first time, you must run the setup script to create the global test set and master feature list. [cite: 189]

```bash
python prepare_global_test_set.py
```

### 4\. Run the Simulation

The system consists of four main components that must be run simultaneously, each in its own terminal window.

  * **Terminal 1: Start the MQTT Broker**

    ```bash
    # (Ensure your MQTT broker is running on localhost:1883)
    mosquitto -c mosquitto.conf
    ```

  * **Terminal 2: Start the Vigilance Server**
    The server is the central brain. The `--threshold` argument sets how many device updates it waits for before starting an aggregation round.

    ```bash
    python server_main.py --threshold 3
    ```

  * **Terminal 3 (and 4, 5...): Start the IoT Device Clients**
    Launch a separate client for each simulated device, giving each a unique `--id`.

    ```bash
    python federated_learning_loop.py --id device_1
    python federated_learning_loop.py --id device_2
    python federated_learning_loop.py --id device_3
    ```

  * **Terminal 6: Start the Data & Attack Simulator**
    This script will discover the running clients and begin streaming data to them. [cite\_start]The `--num-devices` argument must match the number of clients you started. [cite: 362]

    ```bash
    python data_stream_simulator.py --num-devices 3
    ```

  * **Terminal 7: Launch the Dashboard**
    Start the Streamlit web application to monitor the system in real-time.

    ```bash
    streamlit run vulnerability_report_review.py
    ```

    Now, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

## üèõÔ∏è System Architecture

The Vigilance framework is built on a robust, decoupled architecture where components communicate securely and efficiently via an MQTT broker.

1.  [cite\_start]**Data Stream Simulator**: Simulates a smart city environment, distributing normal and malicious data to clients. [cite: 904, 905]
2.  **Federated Learning Clients**: Represent individual IoT devices. [cite\_start]They train local models and report their findings (weights) without exposing raw data. [cite: 908]
3.  [cite\_start]**Aggregation Server**: The central headquarters that collects weights, runs the advanced defense algorithms to filter out threats, aggregates the trusted updates, and distributes the improved global model. [cite: 910, 911]
4.  [cite\_start]**Vulnerability Dashboard**: The command center for human operators, providing real-time visibility into the system's health and security status. [cite: 913]
